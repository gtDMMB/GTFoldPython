This document contains some style guidelines for code in this project

For compound names, prefer under_scores over camelCase.


For curly brace guidelines, prefer at the end of the line instead of the
beginning of the next line:

for(i=0; i<10; i++) {
    sum += i;
}

is better than

for(i=0; i<10; i++)
{
    sum += i;
}
